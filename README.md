## Future features

## Project Review

In the beginning, things were moving a long well. The grid was built using
 flex and inline-flex. The other helpful feature to build the grid was chrome 
 dev tools. This allowed for quick changes in my CSS to see how that would affect
 the grid. When the grid looked good, I was able to copy the changes to the actually
 file. 

For the grid cells to change color, the colors were going to change when
 mouse button was down and the mouse went over the cell. This worked for the most 
 part. There was a bug every so often that the mouse down would get stuck. When
 the mouse would go over the cell, the cell would not change colors.
